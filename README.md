# DistanceBW2points
DISTANCE BETWEEN 2 POINTS Distance between 2 points   Mrs. Anitha , our favourite Maths teacher wanted to teach her new batch of students to find the distance between 2 points. Write a program to accept 2 points and to calculate distance between them using functions and pointers.   Function Specification:  float distance(int *x1, int *y1, int *x2, int *y2) This function returns the distance between two points.   Input Format:  Input consists of 4 integers. The first 2 integers refers to x and y coordinate of Point 1 The next 2 integers refers to x and y coordinate of Point 2   Output Format:  Output consists of 1 float. Display the output correct to 2 decimal places.   [All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]  Sample Input and Output: Enter x1 2 Enter y1 3 Enter x2 4 Enter y2 1 Distance between 2 points is 2.83
